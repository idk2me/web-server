# web-server
My attempt at building a webserver
# What do we need?
### Definition
A webserver is just a computer that stores web software and it's component's files. It has to connect to the internet and support data exchange with other web servers.
### Software side
Includes several parts that control how users access the hosted files. This is a HTTP server that at minimum understands URLs and HTTP. This should be accessed only by domain addresses of the websites that the web server holds. 

# Types of web servers
### Static web servers
A computer that has a HTTP server. It is called static because it sends components as-is to users browser. 
### Dynamic web servers
A computer that has a HTTP server, yes that means it also contains a static web server. The difference is that it usually also contains extra software and a database. The reason it's dynamic is because the hosted files are updated before sending them out to a user's browser. 
## My goal
For now I'm gonna try and make a static web server that hosts some HTML and CSS. I have 3 goals with this project: 
- Deepening my understanding of networking
- Understanding how the backend works
- Learning Go 

If there are any employers out there, hmu.
